# Echo_Shell
> Guarding, echoing, and grading projects -  a lightweight shell for testing embedded systems and other projects

**EchoSentinel** is a compact, extensible evaluation shell that runs as a local/CI tool to automatically test, score, and give feedback on projects and programs - especially targeted at students projects
and automated exam grading. Think of it as a guardian (sentinel) that quietly listens (echo) to program behavior and repors back with structures, actionable feedback.

> Analogy: EchoSentinel is like a `TA` who never sleeps - it watches the lab bench, thaps the code with a stethoscope and write a clear report.

This new project solve many problems by providing a single-command evaluation shell for projects.
it will produce audit, reports and logs..
easily extensible: implementing a plugin for new test types, hardware infterfaces scoring policies.
[In process..]
